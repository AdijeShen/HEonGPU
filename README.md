# HEonGPU
HEonGPU is a high-performance library that optimizes Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) on GPUs. Leveraging GPU parallelism, it reduces computational load through concurrent execution. Its multi-stream architecture minimizes data transfer overhead, making it ideal for large-scale encrypted computations with reduced latency.
